Decimal number system
Decimal (Base 10 ):

The decimal number system , also known as
the base- 10 system, is the most used number
system in everyday life. It is based on ten
digits : 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9.

Each position in a decimal number represents
a power of 10 , starting from the rightmost
digit, which is 100 = 1. As you move left, the
value of the position increases by powers of
10. The rightmost digit (first position)
represents the ones place ( 100 = 1 ). The
second position represents the tens place
( 101 = 10 ). The third position represents the
hundreds place ( 102 = 100 ), and so on.

102 = 100 101 = 10 100 = 1
4 5 2
Consider the decimal number 452 :

    The digit 4 is in the hundreds place ,
    so it represents 4 × 100 = 400.
    The digit 5 is in the tens place ,
    so it represents 5 × 10 = 50.
    The digit 2 is in the ones place ,
    so it represents 2 × 1 = 2.

Thus, 452 is the sum of 400 + 50 + 2.
Binary number system
Binary (Base 2 ):

The binary number system , also known as
base- 2 , is a number system used primarily in
computers and digital systems. It is based on
two digits : 0 and 1.

Each position in a binary number represents a
power of 2 , starting from the rightmost digit,
which is 20 = 1. The next position to the left
represents 21 = 2 , the next one represents
22 = 4 , and so on.

23 = 8 22 = 4 21 = 2 20 = 1
1 0 1 1
Consider the binary number 1011 :

    The rightmost 1 is in the 20 place,
    so it represents 1 × 1 = 1.
    The next 1 is in the 21 place,
    so it represents 1 × 2 = 2.
    The next 0 is in the 22 place,
    so it represents 0 × 4 = 0.
    The leftmost 1 is in the 23 place,
    so it represents 1 × 8 = 8.

So, 1011 in binary equals 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 in
decimal.
Octal number system
Octal (Base 8 ):

The octal number system , also known as
base- 8 , is a number system that uses eight
digits : 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7. It’s less
commonly used than the decimal or binary
systems but has applications in computing,
especially in some older systems and when
simplifying binary representations.

Each position in an octal number represents a
power of 8 , starting from the rightmost digit,
which is 80 = 1. The next represents 81 = 8 , the
next is 82 = 64 , and so on.

Consider the octal number 725 :

    The rightmost 5 is in the 80 place,
    so it represents 5 × 1 = 5.
    The next digit 2 is in the 81 place,
    so it represents 2 × 8 = 16.
    The leftmost digit 7 is in the 82 place,
    so it represents 7 × 64 = 448.

Thus, 725 in octal equals 448 + 16 + 5 = 469 in
decimal.
82 = 64 81 = 8 80 = 1
7 2 5
Hexadecimal number system
Hexadecimal (Base 16 ):

The hexadecimal number system , also known
as base- 16 , is a number system that uses 16
symbols : the digits 0 to 9 and the letters A to F
(representing the values 10 to 15 ). It is widely
used in computing because it provides a
compact and human-friendly way of
representing large binary numbers.

Each position in a hexadecimal number
represents a power of 16 , starting from the
rightmost digit, which is 160 = 1. The next
represents 161 = 16 , the next is 162 = 256 , and
so on.

Consider the hexadecimal number 2F3 :
162 = 256 161 = 16 160 = 1
2 F 3

    The rightmost 3 is in the 160 place,
    so it represents 3 × 1 = 3.
    The next F is in the 161 place,
    so it represents 15 × 16 = 240.
    The leftmost 2 is in the 162 place,
    so it represents 2 × 256 = 512.

Thus, 2F3 in hexadecimal equals 512 + 240 + 3 = 755
in decimal.

Decimal to binary
Divide by 2 :

Converting a decimal number to binary involves
dividing the decimal number by 2 and recording
the remainders.

Steps to Convert Decimal to Binary:

    Divide the decimal number by 2.
    Record the remainder (it will be either 0 or 1).
    Divide the quotient (the result of the division)
    by 2 again.
    Repeat the process until the quotient becomes 0.
    Read the remainders from bottom to top to get the
    binary equivalent.

Example: Convert Decimal 19 to Binary

    19 ÷ 2 = 9, remainder 1
    9 ÷ 2 = 4, remainder 1
    4 ÷ 2 = 2, remainder 0
    2 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 0
    1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1

Now, reading the remainders from bottom to top,
the binary representation of 19 is 10011.
Decimal to octal
Divide by 8 :

To convert a decimal number to octal (base-8), the
method is similar to the decimal-to-binary
conversion but instead of dividing by 2, you divide
by 8.

Steps to Convert Decimal to Octal:

    Divide the decimal number by 8.
    Record the remainder
    (this will be a digit between 0 and 7).
    Divide the quotient by 8.
    Repeat the process until the quotient
    becomes 0.
    Read the remainders from bottom to top to
    get the octal equivalent.

Example: Convert Decimal 78 to Octal

    78 ÷ 8 = 9, remainder 6
    9 ÷ 8 = 1, remainder 1
    1 ÷ 8 = 0, remainder 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the
octal representation of 78 is 116.
Decimal to hexadecimal
Divide by 16 :

To convert a decimal number to hexadecimal
(base-16), you divide the number by 16 and use
the remainders to form the hexadecimal
equivalent.

    Divide the decimal number by 16.
    Record the remainder, which will be a value
    from 0 to 15.
    Divide the quotient by 16.
    Repeat until the quotient becomes 0.
    Read the remainders from bottom to top to get
    the hexadecimal value.

Example: Convert Decimal 945 to Hexadecimal

    945 ÷ 16 = 59, remainder 1
    59 ÷ 16 = 3, remainder 11 (B in hex)
    3 ÷ 16 = 0, remainder 3

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the
hexadecimal representation of 945 is 3B1.

Binary to octal
Groups of 3 bits:

To convert a binary number to octal , you can
follow a simple process that involves grouping
the binary digits (bits) into sets of three. This is
because one octal digit corresponds to three
binary digits (since 23 = 8 ).

Steps to Convert Binary to Octal:

    Group the binary digits in sets of three,
    starting from the right. If there are fewer than
    three digits in the leftmost group, add extra 0 s
    to the left.
    Convert each group of three binary digits to its
    equivalent octal digit.
    Combine the octal digits to get the final octal
    number.

Example: Convert Binary 111101 to Octal

    Group the binary digits into sets of three:
    111101
    Convert each group of three:
        111 in binary = 7 in octal.
        101 in binary = 5 in octal.
    Combine the octal digits:
    The binary number 111101 is 75 in octal.

Binary to hexadecimal
Groups of 4 bits:

To convert a binary number to hexadecimal ,
you can group the binary digits into sets of
four because one hexadecimal digit
corresponds to four binary digits
(since 24 = 16 ).

Steps to Convert Binary to Hexadecimal:

    Group the binary digits in sets of four, starting
    from the right. If there are fewer than four
    digits in the leftmost group, add extra 0 s to the
    left.
    Convert each group of four binary digits to its
    equivalent hexadecimal digit.
    Combine the hexadecimal digits to get the final
    hexadecimal number.

Example: Convert Binary 11011110 to Hexadecimal

    Group the binary digits into sets of four:
    11011110
    Convert each group of four:
        1101 in binary = D in hexadecimal
        (since 1101= D in hex).
        1110 in binary = E in hexadecimal.
    Combine the hexadecimal digits:
    The binary number 11011110 is DE in
    hexadecimal.

Data
Bits & Bytes:

A bit (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data
in a computer, representing a value of either 0
or 1. It serves as the basic building block of
binary code, the language of computers,
where each bit signifies a binary choice, such
as On or Off or True or False. Bits are
fundamental to all digital data representation.
A byte consists of 8 bits and is the standard
unit used to represent a character of data,
such as a letter or symbol. It can represent 256
different values ( 0 - 255 in decimal) and is
commonly used to measure file sizes and
memory capacity. Hierarchically, data is often
measured in bytes, kilobytes (KB), megabytes
(MB), gigabytes (GB), and terabytes (TB).

Data
Numbers:

In computers, binary data is represented using
bits (binary digits), where each bit can be
either a 0 or a 1.

Groups of bits can represent larger numbers:
8 bits = 1 byte (e.g., the decimal number 255
in binary is 11111111 ). Larger data types, like
integers and floating-point numbers, use
multiple bytes.

When numbers are stored in a computer, they
are stored as binary data. Operations like
addition, subtraction, and multiplication are
performed using binary arithmetic.

Data
Characters:

Characters are translated into numbers on a
computer using character encoding systems. In
the ASCII model, characters are translated into
numbers using 7 bits , allowing for 128 unique
characters. These include uppercase and
lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z), digits ( 0 - 9 ),
punctuation symbols, and control characters like
newlines. The ASCII extended model uses 8 bits.

Each character is mapped to a specific number,
for example, 'A' is represented by 65 , and 'a' by
97. ASCII is a simple and foundational encoding
system that allows computers to represent text
as numbers.

Data
Colors:

Colors on a computer are represented using
numbers through color models , with the RGB
model being the most common. In RGB, each
color is defined by three numbers ( Red , Green ,
and Blue ), each ranging from 0 to 255 , where
different combinations create various colors.
For example, ( 255 , 0 , 0 ) is pure red. These RGB
values can also be represented as hexadecimal
(e.g., #FF 0000 for red).

Bit depth defines the range of colors a system
can represent, with higher bit depths offering
more color precision. 8 - bit per channel ( 24 - bit
color): Standard RGB, allows 16. 7 million colors.

    Decimal
    Hexadecimal

Activity
Data
Images:

Images in the RGB color model are made up of a
grid of pixels , where each pixel is assigned a
specific color based on Red, Green, and Blue
(RGB) values. Each pixel's color is defined by
three numbers ( 0 - 255 for each RGB component).
The collection of RGB values for all pixels forms
the complete image, and this data is stored in
image files (like JPEG , PNG , BMP ).

In uncompressed formats (e.g., BMP ), each
pixel’s RGB value is explicitly stored. In
compressed formats (e.g., JPEG ), the image is
optimized to save storage space while keeping
the appearance intact.
